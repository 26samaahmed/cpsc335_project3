# Path Visualizer
A Smart Campus Navigator that prompts the user to enter a task that they want to get done at a specific time and place. Once the user clicks submit, we display a visualization of the shortest path to the task’s destination, starting from where the user currently is. The tasks are auto sorted and will prompt the user to re-enter the time if the inputted task overlaps with another existent task.

## Run the project
